# Synthetic Embryo

In this repository, we will host materials (simulations, visualizations) of a synthetic embryo.  

Synthetic (or Numeric) Embryo:

Timing data: a binary tree with branches every _n_ units of developmental time.  

* look at the distribution of branching events (simulated using Uniform, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions).
